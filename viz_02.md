## Exploratory Data Analysis of Gene Expression Dataset

Exploratory data analysis dives deep into gene expression data to
uncover the inherent patterns and make sense of it. To accomplish this,
several plots are used:

-   Box plot
-   Violin plot
-   Stripchart
-   Dot plot
-   Histogram and density plots
-   ECDF plot
-   Q-Q plot
-   Volcano plot
-   Heatmaps
-   Dendograms

For this practice set, will generate box violin using gene expressioni
data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Dataset.
